            <article>
                Hi! I'm Ada, Countess of Lovelace and am an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for my work
                on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am one of the first to recognize that machines have applications beyond pure calculation, and to have
                published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.
                In my free time I like to read about scientific developments, mathematics, and computational mathematics.
                I also like to take my chances of winning big.
                <br>
                <br>
                Fun fact! I've been programing for NaN seconds!

                    My work inspired the United States Department of Defense to name
                    their new programming language after me.

                    Build a webpage for a neat Teashop. I was using HTML, CSS and Git. I was working with the phpStorm
                    IDE (Jetbrains).
